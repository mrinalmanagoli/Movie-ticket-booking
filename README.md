# Movie ticket booking application Vision statement
---

The Ixalan theatre's ticket booking application will be used for booking and managing ticket
purchases for Ixalan theatre locations. The application will be available on Android Devices
initially and eventually will add Desktop, Android tablets, iOS tablets and smartphones.
The application will initially show a login screen with a create am account option or proceed as a
guest option. The application will prompt for city and display movies that are currently being shown
by Ixalan movie theatres in that city.

The application will display the titles of the movies with their corresponding poster and allow
users to order movies by rating, release date, and title. It will also allow users to search for
movies based on titles. Upon selecting a movie, more specific details of about the movie will be
displayed such as the rating, cast, synopsis, trailers, and merchandise. Users will be able to
start a booking from either the main screen or a movie specific page.

Booking tickets will show users available times and theatre locations. Users will also be able to
see the vacant seats visually and book selected seating locations. Users will be able to book more
than one ticket for any given booking but all for the same date and time. Users will be able to see
a final booking summary in a shopping cart. Payment for tickets can be made and processed in-app
through various means, such as Android Pay, Apple Pay, and Credit/Debit cards. Finalized bookings can
be sent to users through email or via text messages using a phone number, which can be saved if you
are logged in.

After bookings have been made to registered accounts, users will be able to view their booking history.
This history will show when the booking was made, what movie was booked and which location it was booked
for. Registered accounts will have the added features of a history-based recommendations list and a Loyalty
program. This loyalty program gives points based on purchases that can be used for discounts or free bookings.
The last thing the application will do is have Administration accounts meant for Managers of theatre locations.
This Administration view will allow managers to add merchandise, make changes to existing bookings, cancelling
or reschedule shows, and applying refunds. These features will be available on top of being able to do all other
functionality users have access to.

The application has two primary shareholders of the general movie-going public and managers of the Ixalan theatre
locations. With Secondary shareholders being on-location employees of Ixalan theatres and help desk employees. We
will have an emphasis on the key demographic of 18-34 as this demographic has a large amount of expendable income.
This demographic is more likely to want to go out on a Friday or Saturday evening an watch a movie.

The Value that this application is aiming for is to allow users to save time by booking tickets ahead of time and
reduce wait times in-line at theatres. Having this in mind we have set a primary success criterion for this application
to be able to allow a user to book tickets and specific seats at any Ixalan theatre location. With these dates
being as far out as a month or as few as 1 hours before the movie start time. This can be measured by comparing
ticket sales to line wait times as compared to before and after the launch of the application. With a target
reduction of waiting line times of at least 10%.

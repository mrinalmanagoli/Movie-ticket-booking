Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the
feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

The UI based feature that we targeted for iteration 1 was for a user to be able to see what movies
are being shown currently, filter movies, and look up movies [Movies feature](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/1). This feature had three user stories linked to it.

* [look up movies](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/4)
* [filter movies](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/3)
* [See what movies are on](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/2)

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

Provide a link to where you describe your branching strategy.

Provide screen shot of a feature being added using your branching strategy
successfully. The [GitLab Graph tool can do this](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/cook-eBook/-/network/develop),
as well as using `git log --graph`.

SOLID
-----

Find a SOLID violation in the project of group `(n%12)+1` (group 4 four us) (group 12 does group 1).
Open an issue in their project with the violation,
clearly explaining the SOLID violation - specifying the type, provide a link to that issue. Be sure
your links in the issues are to **specific commits** (not to `main`, or `develop` as those will be changed).

Provide a link to the issue you created here.

Agile Planning
--------------

During iteration 1, the plan for what had to be completed for iteration 1 did not change. The single feature
we had aimed to get done for iteration 1 was completed. What we did change during iteration 1 was, we dropped
the implementation of apple and android pay that we had initial talked about.

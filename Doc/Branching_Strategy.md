The branching strategy we chose was GitHub Flow. 

Since there are several features and a lot of moving parts within the group, we thought it would be best to use this strategy as one can just branch off master and work on any feature independently.

Additionally, this is also one of the more popular strategies and one all group members are familiar with.

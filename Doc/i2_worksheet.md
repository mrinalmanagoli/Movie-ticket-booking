Iteration 2 Worksheet
=====================

Paying off technical debt
-----------------

**Show *two* instances of your group paying off technical debt. For these two instances:**

* **Explain how your are paying off the technical debt.**
* **Show commits, links to lines in your commit where you paid off technical debt.**
* **Classify the debt, and justify why you chose that classification with 1-3 sentences.**

The first technical debt that we paid off is that we addressed and fixed the code smells we had in our project. We would classify this debt as reckless and prudent.

The links to those issues are given below:

* [No Access Control Code Smell (Fixed)](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/commit/f4d50b1fe0ae2dbb26b0ec6638baa56a77b1ee5b)
* [Data Layer in Business Layer Code Smell (Fixed)](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/42)
* [Empty Main Code Smell (Fixed)](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/41)
* [Gross Package Path Code Smell (Fixed)](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-3/-/issues/40)


The second instance of paying off technical debt is that we seperated the UserDB inside our data layer, which would later help us during implementation or making changes. We would classify this as reckless and prudent technical debt because in our last iteration, we were in a time crunch and had to intentionally incur this technical debt.

SOLID
-----------------

**Find a SOLID violation in the project of group with the same group number in the next class over - (n%3)+1 (A03 does A01) Open an issue in their project with the violation, clearly explaining the SOLID violation - specifying the type, provide a link to that issue. Be sure your links in the issues are to specific commits (not to main, or develop as those will be changed).**

**Provide a link to the issue you created here.**

We looked for a SOLID violation in Group 3 of Section A02. [Here](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a02/thrive/-/issues/23) is an issue that we found. 

Retrospective
-----------------

**Describe how the retrospective has changed the way you are doing your project. Is there evidence of the change in estimating/committing/peer review/timelines/testing? Provide those links and evidence here - or explain why there is not evidence.**

Our retrospective this time did not change much from our last iterations. We all communicated well, divided up our work, and got our jobs done as best we could. We also came forward and put everything together at the end.

There is no evidence of change in estimating/timelines/testing on GitLab itself but we communicated internally using our own mediums of communication (Discord and Gather).

Design patterns
-----------------

**Show links to your project where you use a well-known design pattern. Which pattern is it? Provide links to the design pattern that you used.**

***Note*: Though Dependency Injection is a programming pattern, we would like to see a programming pattern other than Dependency Injections.**

Iteration 2 Worksheet
=====================

Paying off technical debt
-----------------

**Show *two* instances of your group paying off technical debt. For these two instances:**

* **Explain how your are paying off the technical debt.**
* **Show commits, links to lines in your commit where you paid off technical debt.**
* **Classify the debt, and justify why you chose that classification with 1-3 sentences.**

SOLID
-----------------

**Find a SOLID violation in the project of group with the same group number in the next class over - (n%3)+1 (A03 does A01) Open an issue in their project with the violation, clearly explaining the SOLID violation - specifying the type, provide a link to that issue. Be sure your links in the issues are to specific commits (not to main, or develop as those will be changed).**

**Provide a link to the issue you created here.**

Retrospective
-----------------

**Describe how the retrospective has changed the way you are doing your project. Is there evidence of the change in estimating/committing/peer review/timelines/testing? Provide those links and evidence here - or explain why there is not evidence.**

Design patterns
-----------------

**Show links to your project where you use a well-known design pattern. Which pattern is it? Provide links to the design pattern that you used.**

***Note*: Though Dependency Injection is a programming pattern, we would like to see a programming pattern other than Dependency Injections.**

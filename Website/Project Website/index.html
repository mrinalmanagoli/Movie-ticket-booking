  <h1 class="text-change"> A Vision for A better booking Experience</h1>

<p class="text-change" style="margin-right: 30px;">
  The Ixalan theatre's ticket booking application will be used for booking and managing ticket
  purchases for Ixalan theatre locations. The application will be available on Android Devices
  initially and eventually will add Desktop, Android tablets, iOS tablets and smartphones.
  The application will initially show a login screen with a create am account option or proceed as a
  guest option. The application will prompt for city and display movies that are currently being shown
  by Ixalan movie theatres in that city.

  The application will display the titles of the movies with their corresponding poster and allow
  users to order movies by rating, release date, and title. It will also allow users to search for
  movies based on titles. Upon selecting a movie, more specific details of about the movie will be
  displayed such as the rating, cast, synopsis, trailers, and merchandise. Users will be able to
  start a booking from either the main screen or a movie specific page.

  Booking tickets will show users available times and theatre locations. Users will also be able to
  see the vacant seats visually and book selected seating locations. Users will be able to book more
  than one ticket for any given booking but all for the same date and time. Users will be able to see
  a final booking summary in a shopping cart. Payment for tickets can be made and processed in-app
  through various means, such as Android Pay, Apple Pay, and Credit/Debit cards. Finalized bookings can
  be sent to users through email or via text messages using a phone number, which can be saved if you
  are logged in.

  After bookings have been made to registered accounts, users will be able to view their booking history.
  This history will show when the booking was made, what movie was booked and which location it was booked
  for. Registered accounts will have the added features of a history-based recommendations list and a Loyalty
  program. This loyalty program gives points based on purchases that can be used for discounts or free bookings.
  The last thing the application will do is have Administration accounts meant for Managers of theatre locations.
  This Administration view will allow managers to add merchandise, make changes to existing bookings, cancelling
  or reschedule shows, and applying refunds. These features will be available on top of being able to do all other
  functionality users have access to.

  The application has two primary shareholders of the general movie-going public and managers of the Ixalan theatre
  locations. With Secondary shareholders being on-location employees of Ixalan theatres and help desk employees. We
  will have an emphasis on the key demographic of 18-34 as this demographic has a large amount of expendable income.
  This demographic is more likely to want to go out on a Friday or Saturday evening an watch a movie.

  The Value that this application is aiming for is to allow users to save time by booking tickets ahead of time and
  reduce wait times in-line at theatres. Having this in mind we have set a primary success criterion for this application
  to be able to allow a user to book tickets and specific seats at any Ixalan theatre location. With these dates
  being as far out as a month or as few as 1 hours before the movie start time. This can be measured by comparing
  ticket sales to line wait times as compared to before and after the launch of the application. With a target
  reduction of waiting line times of at least 10%.

<h1 class="text-change">Postmortem</h1>
<p class="text-change">Our team completeted a retrospective activity and discussed the issues we had throughout the entire term. We discussed some of the
problems we previously had. The first issue we had was with using Gitlab, since some of our members were not fully proficient in using git/github for version
control. This resulted in some members having to commit and push changes on behalf of other members, making the commits on in our
project very inconsistent and more difficult to track.

The other issue we had was due to some misestimation of time and workload in implementing some of the features/user stories.
We ran into some issues in Iteration 2 near the end and had to make some last minute changes, which altogether made our app a little
awkward. We still decided to push through and try to get everything that we had scheduled done. This turned out to be a bit of a challenge
we didn't take into account how many problems we would have with the database. With start and stops and one member would ask if the app
was running properly for everyone else which we would have to stop and take a look at. We had issues merging and branches being merged
before the branches were completeted. There were some communication issues with when the branches were done or would be done. We underestimated
how long some of the features would take or what they would require. With the database constantly needing to be updated to be able to
complete a feature as was imagened.

Looking back we could have maybe outlined the data structures and objects better and communicated better how things were actually
implemented in the database. Not everyone in our group had taken database so that did bring up some issues. The final release
follows the demo system quite closely. We were surprised by how many times we had to go back to the database with the script jumping
from 40 lines of SQL to finishing at 400 lines. with several new classes needing to be created just to be able to implement the features
we had planned.

The Project mostly stayed on course interms of what we wanted it to do and accomplish. With several pit falls along the way we really saw how it can
change and evolve and present new problems we didn't even consider. We lost alot a of time on the database and alot of if having to do with silly spelling
mistakes that no one notice or took us a long time to find. For this final iteration we really put an emphasis on not ending with any half working code or
buggs in our code. everything that ends up in the final merge should pass its tests and work to try and cover all its possible short comings.

    <div class="flex-item">
        <p class="text-change">
        As we can see from out Velocity chart we tended to over estimate how much work we could actually get done.
        with the last two Iteration really suffering from the database setting use back on the work we actually had to get done.
        We definetly pulled together to push to get everything we wanted to get done in for their milestones. But these push did come in heavily
        closer to our deadlines. We probably could have pushed for a bit more work early on in the project to light the load at the back end.
